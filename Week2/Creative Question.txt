## Creative Questions

  a) What was your creative question, why did you find it interesting?, 
     What question did you ultimately choose to pair with data set from?
	
  b) What was the question you asked, were you able to match it against one of the 
     existing data sets, if not, what question could you answer or further understand
     the question (explore, further clarify the problem or answer that question) 
     with the existing data sets?

  c) Why did you choose to match this dataset against that question?
	2-3 sentences explaining various aspects that would make the data/question a 
	good fit for each other (i.e. does it help explain certain aspects of the 
	question...is it supportive of a certain type of analysis, is it missing 
	certain pieces of data but overall has some net positive value, etc.)

## Output

  a) My first creative question was: "How does investment in the Baja 
     California, MX (Tijuana, Mexicali, Ensenada) region 
     affect the exports and labor markets in Southern California?". 

	 I wanted to better understand the relationship between Southern California and
	 the Baja region; whether investment in Baja resulted in economic growth in 
	 Southern California or if it resulted in the opposite effect, maybe a strong 
	 Baja region resulted in less dependence on exports (in services and manufacturing) 
	 from California or maybe it benefits both regions by increasing commerce between 
	 them.
	 
  b) I wasn't able to match it against existing data sets because I couldn't 
	 find aggregated open data published by the Mexican Gov. related to foreign or local 
	 investment in such region, maybe it exists in local websites of each govs 
	 but it's a long shot.

	 Because I was not able to match my original question to an existing data set, 
	 I pivoted to the following one: "How effective is the Californian population 
	 in addressing future market needs?", I want to determine whether 
	 entreprenurial californians are pursuing the right opportunities, I decided
	 to pair such question with the following dataset: 
	 
	   1. https://data.ca.gov/dataset/regional-economic-analysis-profiles
	   2. https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography/geographies/reference-maps.html

  c) I think that the chosen data set addresses projected areas of growth in terms
    of investment and employment. I think it's a good starting data set, as it provides
	past forecasts and I could pair such forecasts with the data tha contains the businesses
	that were created after such forecasts were published I would also pair it with
	information from the Census Bureau with businesses created and closed during a 
	specific period of time.
